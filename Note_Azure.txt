3 categories:
1.Platform as a Service (PaaS)
2.Infrastructure as a Service -> VM
3.Software as a Service -> Regular Users, Office 365, Google Docs, Google Drive...

Target: ASP.NET Core app to be on Server so that people can start using it.

Windows Server -> IIs
Linux Server -> Ngix

DataCenter -> Physical Location: servers(Win/Linux), Costs, Security...

Option1: buy Azure VM (infrastructure service), install Win/Linux service, deploy app.
Cons: you need to manage the OS updates, need to manage any server patches, manage SSL certificates, IP, Domain names.

Option2: Platform as a service. (do not need to manage infrastructure)
Azure App Service -> java/ python/ .Net different app
Azure SQL
Azure Functions
Azure Blob Storage
Azure Cognitive Service ->Face ID, ML
Azure Dev Ops -> Development + Operations

Company Process:
QA Team
Business Team
Users

.Net Team:  MVC developed first 3 pages -> check code in GitHub -> Aotomaticlly do:
            1.Publish our app to Server (Azure App Service) http://qa.movieshop.com
            2.run Unit Test Cases

To the above 2 goals, configure the Azure DevOps
CI -> Continus Integration: take the code from GitHub, build code and run any unit test cases. Trigged everytime when new code checkin Github.
     If failed: notify
     If passed: go to CD

CD -> Continus Delivery: it will take the passed build and deploy to Azure APP Service automatically.
